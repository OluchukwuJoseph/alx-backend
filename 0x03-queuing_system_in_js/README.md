# 0x03. Queuing System in JavaScript
Description
This project focuses on building and understanding queuing systems using Redis as the primary message broker. You'll explore the implementation of producer-consumer patterns and learn how to handle asynchronous job processing effectively in JavaScript. This is a critical concept in backend development, particularly in designing scalable, distributed systems.
